Speaker A: Hello?
Speaker B: Yeah, hi, Rochat here.
Speaker A: Yeah, okay, I have seen that. Is that under 600 or is it more? Because my budget is 600 per month.
Speaker B: It is 700.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. Is it only for a month or six weeks? Because.
Speaker B: Just for six weeks.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: I'll tell you how exactly the accommodation can show up. There are two major intakes, January and September. Okay. So in January you booked an accommodation with a move in of the 21st of June. Right?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So now what happens is there is no accommodation that's directly available from June or July for six months or one year. Because after a month we have the September intake and from September intake the property offers long term stays. Okay.
Speaker A: Basically I was looking for a long time stay.
Speaker B: I can help you with a long term stay but if you want to stay, you know in a short term accommodation what we generally do is. So with the move in of 16th of July until the 30th of August I can help you with this accommodation. It's 175 pounds per week. It's a very good option. Right then September. Yeah, 175 pounds per week. And then from September onwards I can help you with another tenancy if either in this accommodation or some other accommodation as per your budget.
Speaker A: Okay? Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll discuss with my family and I'll inform you.
Speaker B: Okay, sure. And how was the stay at Edinburgh College residents we helped?
Speaker A: It was, it was so good. It was so good. Still I'm looking for flat there but it was, it is not available right now.
Speaker B: It is available from September on, from the, the last week of August onwards. I. Let me just tell you just one minute.
Speaker A: Okay. You have just send me the properties. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: Ensuite is available from the 23rd of August but the rent is Â£194 per week.
Speaker A: No, no, that's too much.
Speaker B: Yeah. So what I'll suggest you right now is you know, you, you can go ahead with this particular property because this is, you know, the only option for now keep.
Speaker A: Okay, okay.
Speaker B: And yeah, and after that what we can do is we can directly, you know, book some other accommodation properly within your budget.
Speaker A: If, if it's possible you can extend the tenancy after August, right?
Speaker B: Yeah, you can, but it again depends on the availability and the rent at that point of time which the property did not, you know, showed currently. They are not showing it currently. For now we can consider a short term staying behavior.
Speaker A: Okay. The thing is that if I'm looking for this properties I need to extend it after September. That's what I need because I am looking for a long term stay.
Speaker B: Long. See, long term stay is something I can definitely help you with, but for that we need to, you know, rebook the same accommodation or check for someone.
Speaker A: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's when I rebook at that.
Speaker B: Time now, like there won't be any option, you know, with the July move in for the whole year. Okay, that won't be possible. Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay, so for the time being, I need to book a short term now and then need to rebook it.
Speaker B: Right, okay, Correct. Because. Because all the accommodations are available from September onwards for the long.
Speaker A: Okay, yeah, got it. I'll inform you. Yeah. Okay. Just give me a date. Yeah, sure. Thank you.
Speaker B: No problem.
