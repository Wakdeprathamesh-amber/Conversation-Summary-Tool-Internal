Speaker A: Hello. Yeah, hi, am I speaking with Shishti? Yes. Yeah, hi Srishti, good evening. I'm Rachi from Amber Student for accommodation assistance. We received information from Kanan International that you're looking for accommodation in uk. Yeah, but I've already spoken to the consultancy and I've booked an accommodation for myself today. Oh, so you have booked your accommodation? Yeah, already on the process. Okay, so with whom you are booking? Like if you can just tell us. I am booking. The accommodation is called Canvas the old fire station. Okay. And you're booking with the consultancy only? Yeah, International. Right. Okay. So they are the ones who provided us the information. Not a problem. So if in case you require any assistance further so you can connect with us as I have already whatsapped you and if you like have anyone else who is looking for an accommodation so you can refer that person and get 50 pounds of a cash back.
